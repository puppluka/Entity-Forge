Features that are still left to be implemented:



	-Full GUI Support for Top-Level Directives:
The application can now parse and display directives like @mapsize, @version, etc., but the GUI does not yet allow you to create or edit them.
The "New" button in the element list needs to be updated to allow for the creation of these new directive types, in addition to entity classes.
Dedicated editing interfaces need to be created in the right-hand panel to allow the values of these directives (e.g., the version number for @version or the coordinates for @mapsize) to be modified.

# need to add logic to handle nested blocks like 'choices' or 'flags'.
# The parser is currently skipping them. This involves checking for `[` and `]` and calling the correct parsing method.
