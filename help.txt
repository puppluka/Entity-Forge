Terms:

	FGD File
A text file that defines the entities, properties, and I/O for a game's map editor. Entity Forge is a GUI tool for creating and editing these files without the need for manual text editing.

	Entity
A game object defined within the FGD file, such as a monster, a light, or a door. Each entity has a set of key/value properties and can have inputs and outputs for inter-entity communication.

	BaseClass
A special type of entity that can be inherited by other entities, allowing for shared properties and behaviors. This promotes code reuse and simplifies FGD file management.

	Properties
The attributes of an entity, defined by a key-value pair. A property can be a single value, a choice from a list, or a set of flags. The type of a property determines how it is displayed and edited in the GUI.

	I/O
Inputs and Outputs. These are signals that entities can send and receive, allowing mappers to create complex scripted events and interactions within the game world.

Using Entity Forge:

*******************************************************************************

	<-- File Menu -->

New
Creates blank FGD data file.

Open
Opens an existing FGD file.

Save
Saves the current FGD file. If the file has not been saved before, it will prompt for a filename.

Save As
Saves the current FGD file to a new location with a different name.

Exit
Closes the program.

*******************************************************************************

	<-- Interface -->

Tree View
On the left side of the window, a tree view displays all the elements in your FGD file. Click on any item to select it.

Form View
On the right side of the window, a form displays the editable properties of the currently selected item from the tree view.

*******************************************************************************

	<-- Troubleshooting -->

File Load Errors
If you encounter an error when loading a file, it is likely due to a syntax issue in the FGD file itself. The program should provide an error message with details about the problem.

Program Not Responding
If the program appears to freeze, it may be processing a very large or complex FGD file. Please be patient and allow it to complete the operation.

	<-- TODO -->

- Dedicated editing interfaces need to be created in the right-hand panel to allow the values of these directives (e.g., the version number for @version or the coordinates for @mapsize) to be modified.

- "Editor helpers" should be another additional field like keyvalues and ins/outs. It's a bit odd to see the fields in there and being able to edit them but not add/remove anything

- In the FGD Elements list, it'd be REALLY great if the editor could move them around. It's possible to just shuffle it around by copying and pasting this stuff in one's editor of choice, but assuming it's not super hard to implement it'd be pretty great if it could be moved around

- Duplicate option for FGD elements, in case I need to add an entity that's maybe exactly the same as another one, but with extra options. I refer specifically to cases like func_door vs func_door_rotating in Q2 where it's basically most of the same criteria, but with some extra flags included dictating the axis on which it rotates

- Maybe a drop box for class types when making elements, or element types when making keyvalues; that way the user doesn't have to just type it manually every time.

- Hotkeys. Can't tell you how many times I've tried to ctrl/command/meta-s when making an edit but I realize "wait, I need to actually go to the menu and click save"
